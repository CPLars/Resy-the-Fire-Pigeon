        <div>This is our drone in some of its first stages, we had many dreams for our drone that didn't come to light like adding leds and a arm to grab things but dispite that we made a drone that we can hold our head high to. We laser cut cut the box a 2 times as a prototype and the final but both became diffent then one other.We ran in to the problem size of the wings being wrong and had to resize them. We fought with soildworks while doing so. Also, the hard part of putting on the wings, which took 2 people to do.We had a motor that didn't want to work at first but later got it to work fine. </div>

        <li> Here is it in the middle stages, the middle stages where some of the hards due to everything slowly coming togther but we took our time and bliud it piece by piece. We had some hardships when it can to putting in the electioncal part in the body of the drone but we did it in the end. It took us many days to paint on the design of the drone but it turned out good.There were some troubles with the code but we got them ironed out after a while. For those who are wondering how resy got it name the prototype looked like the resin curing box in the lab we have and the Fire pigeon part was from an inside joke the the team has. </li>

        <li>Here is it in its finally stages, It was fun building it and we had our ups and downs with the project but we a we're proud of what we had made.While we did have a hard time with the wiring staying in we got it to stay put and made a drone that look ready to fly. And I learned that working with a team can be a bit challenging at first, but over time it gets a lot easier to work with people.</li>
